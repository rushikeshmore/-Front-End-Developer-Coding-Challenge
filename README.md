### Things to know for testing üõ†Ô∏è
Please note that we've implemented the Slick JS slider with the 'mobileFirst' setting enabled, meaning it's initialized specifically for mobile devices. As a result, when testing our website on mobile breakpoints, you may need to refresh the page to view the slider properly.

Additionally, we've integrated the fancyapps.com library to enhance the user experience. Clicking on any image will open it in full view, providing an enriched viewing experience. Thank you for your understanding as we strive to optimize the user experience across different devices.
